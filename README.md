# predicting-ppd

Project Overview:
  This project applies supervised machine learning models to predict postpartum depression (PPD) using a Kaggle survey dataset. Three models were implemented: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to demonstrate a full ML workflow including preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
